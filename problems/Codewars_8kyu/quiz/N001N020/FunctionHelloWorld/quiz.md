# Function 1 - hello world

### Description:

Make a simple function called **greet** that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

### Style Points

Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

```javascript
describe("Testing function", function() {
  it("Is it a function?", function() {
    Test.assertEquals(typeof greet, "function", "greet should be a function");
  });
  it("Correct return-value?", function() {
    Test.assertEquals(greet(), "hello world!");
  });
});
```
