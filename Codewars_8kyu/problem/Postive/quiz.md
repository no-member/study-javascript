You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example `[1,-4,7,12]` => `1 + 7 + 12 = 20`

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to `0`.



```javascript
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([1,2,3,4,5]),15);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([1,-2,3,4,5]),13);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([]),0);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]),0);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([-1,2,3,4,-5]),9);
```
